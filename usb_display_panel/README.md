# ESP32-P4 Panel

Renders Home Assistant dashboards onto ESPHome `usb_display` panels over the
network, and replays the panels' touches back into them. It exists so the
panels do not depend on a desktop being switched on: this runs on the machine
that is already on all the time.

One instance serves as many panels as you list. Each gets its own browser, its
own process and its own prefix in the log, and is restarted on its own if it
fails.

## What has to be true first

The panel needs `port:` and `touchscreen_id:` in its `usb_display:` block, and
you need a **long-lived access token** from the bottom of your Home Assistant
profile page.

Run the calibration once per panel, from anywhere, before setting this up --
it prints the `touch_rotate` and mirror values to use, and no two panels agree:

    python ha_send.py --calibrate --host ip esp32P4 --port 5000 \
        --width 1024 --height 600 --rotate 180

## As a Home Assistant add-on

Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on store -> the three dots -> Repositories, and add:

    https://github.com/youkorr/esphome_esp-video

Then install **ESP32-P4 Panel**, fill in the panels in its Configuration tab
and start it. It will start with Home Assistant from then on.

The first build downloads a browser, so give it several minutes and about
1.5 GB of disk.

## With Docker

    mkdir -p config && cp panels.example.json config/panels.json
    $EDITOR config/panels.json
    docker compose up -d

## With systemd

See the header of `esp32p4-panel.service` for the six commands.

## Options

`token`, `url`, `port`, `fps`, `quality` and `stats` can be set once at the top
and every panel inherits them; a panel that sets one for itself keeps its own.
The token in particular is the same for a whole house, and long enough that
repeating it per panel is mostly a way to get one of them wrong.

The token is still required even here, where this runs beside Home Assistant.
An add-on is given a SUPERVISOR_TOKEN, but that authenticates to the Supervisor
rather than to Home Assistant as a user: it cannot log a browser in. Only a
long-lived access token can.

| Option | What it is |
|---|---|
| `name` | What this panel is called in the log |
| `host`, `port` | The panel's address, and its `port:` |
| `url` | The dashboard to render. From inside an add-on this is `http://homeassistant:8123/...` -- see below |
| `token` | A long-lived access token |
| `width`, `height` | Must match the component's |
| `rotate` | Turns the picture, for a panel not mounted upright |
| `touch_rotate`, `touch_mirror_x`, `touch_mirror_y` | From `--calibrate` |
| `fps` | Upper bound on how often a change is acted on |
| `quality` | JPEG quality, 1..95 |
| `stats` | Print what is being sent every five seconds |

## What it costs

A dashboard at rest sends nothing at all: the browser only produces a frame
when the page changes, and only the rectangles that differ are sent. A clock
ticking once a second is about 1.5 KiB/s. A camera card is a different matter
entirely -- that is video, and it costs what video costs.

## The address to give it

From inside an add-on, use the name Home Assistant answers to on the add-on
network:

    url: http://homeassistant:8123/lovelace/0

Not a remote-access address. Tailscale's `*.ts.net`, Nabu Casa's
`*.ui.nabu.casa` and dynamic DNS names exist to reach the house from outside;
they resolve on the network they belong to, and a container sitting beside
Home Assistant is not on it -- the browser reports ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED. It
does not need to be, either: Home Assistant is on the same machine.

Outside an add-on, any address that resolves where the sender runs will do:
the machine's hostname, or Home Assistant's IP and port.
